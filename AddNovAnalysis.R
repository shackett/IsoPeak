#import adduct list from ISOsetup.R
# - adducts of a compound identified by ISOpeakFinder, with a (-) charge.  Adducts are expected to be proportionally related to their derivatized peak (X-H) by a scaling factor to be determined




#import KEGG compounds from ISOsetup.R
# - compounds without a known RT (& aren't known to exist in the sample) but with known isotopic distribution
